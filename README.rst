fastplot

This is a simple program using the Python, NumPy and Matplotlib stack. It just
takes a CSV file with `x` and `y` data points and creates a scatter plot with
them. If a third column is present in the file, it will be assumed to be the
error `\Delta y`.

I even have this as the default program for CSV files on my main machine. That
way, I just have to click on data files in the file manager and get a plot
right away.
